# Monthly Report Dashboard

> **For the AI Agent at the Office Setup:**
> This repository contains the source code for the "Monthly Report Dashboard". It is a **client-facing, premium, editable dashboard** designed to replace the need for sending raw Excel files. It is NOT a data warehouse or an Excel clone.

## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
    *Note: This project is "heavy" because of `node_modules`, which is why it was not checked into git. This command effectively "hypydrates" the project.*

2.  **Start Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Typically runs on `http://localhost:8080` (or similar).

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    **Result**: This creates the `dist/` folder containing the optimized static files.
    *Why wasn't `dist` pushed?* The `dist` folder is a build artifact (generated code). It is standard practice to exclude it from git (via `.gitignore`) to keep the repository clean and avoid merge conflicts. You generate it fresh on your machine.

## 📂 Key Context Documents

We have included two critical strategy documents in the root of this repo. **READ THESE FIRST** to understand the current development state.

1.  **`data_strategy.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Outlines the "Product Mental Model" for resolving data gaps.
    *   **Status**: APPROVED. Describes which Excel columns to ignore (noise), which to preserve (integrity), and which to fix (critical bugs).
    *   **Action**: You need to implement the model changes described here.

2.  **`data_mapping_audit.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A line-by-line traceability report mapping `Sample Report.xlsx` to the Dashboard UI.
    *   **Status**: Reference document for the `data_strategy.md`.

## 🛠 Current Development State

**Phase**: MVP Data Layer Transition

*   **Done**:
    *   Replaced prototype Excel upload with `initializeData.ts` script.
    *   Added "Load Sample Report" button in Admin.
    *   Verified Page Routing (`/`, `/pipeline`, `/archive`).
    *   Cleaned up 30+ unused components.
*   **In Progress**:
    *   Implementing the **Data Strategy** (updating `src/types/data.ts` and parser logic).
    *   Fixing "Ownership vs Client" semantic mismatch.
    *   Adding "Orphaned Warnings" for deliverables.

## 💡 Philosophy (Command Center)

*   **Simplicity**: We prefer a clean UI over showing every single Excel column.
*   **Actionability**: Data shouldn't just sit there; it should drive the "Status" and "Progress".
*   **Traceability**: We must be able to explain *why* a project is "Critical" or "Delayed" based on the Excel input.
